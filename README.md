# Decentraflow System

## 📌 Project Title
**Decentraflow System**

## 📄 Project Description
Decentraflow System is a lightweight decentralized task-management and contribution tracking smart contract built on Ethereum. It enables users to create tasks, mark them as completed, and contribute funds transparently using blockchain technology.

## 🌍 Project Vision
The vision of Decentraflow System is to create a fully decentralized productivity and project-tracking ecosystem where collaboration, transparency, and accountability are embedded into the workflow. No central authority—just the community.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Task Creation:** Users can create tasks with a simple description.
- **Task Completion:** Only task creators may mark their tasks as completed.
- **Contribution Tracking:** Supporters can contribute ETH, all transparently recorded on-chain.
- **Event Logging:** Every important action emits an event for off-chain tracking and analytics.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Multi-user role system (admins, auditors, contributors)
- Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) integration
- Token-based reward mechanisms
- Task deadlines and priority levels
- IPFS integration for storing extended project metadata
- Front-end dApp interface for seamless interaction
